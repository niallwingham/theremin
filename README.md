Virtual Theremin
========

The theremin is an electronic synthesizer that is played without being touched.  Because it gives no haptic feedback, it a natural candidate for virtualization.  This is our implementation of a virtual theremin on the Microsoft Kinect, using algorithms that reliably track hands and recognize simple gestures at 30 frames per second.
